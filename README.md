<h1 align="center">🧠 Brain Tumor Detection</h1>

---

A clean, practical deep learning project that detects brain tumors from MRI/CT images using **YOLOv8** (or CNN-based models) for precise, rapid detection in medical imaging pipelines.

---

<h2 align="center">📌 Project Overview</h2>

This project trains a deep learning model to detect and localize brain tumors in medical images. It can be used for:

- Practicing object detection pipelines end-to-end.
- Understanding YOLOv8 training and fine-tuning.
- Experimenting with medical image preprocessing.
- Developing deployable detection systems for real-world healthcare workflows.

<h2 align="center">🚀 Features</h2>

✅ Clean data loading and annotation parsing  
✅ YOLOv8-based detection pipeline  
✅ Training, validation with mAP, precision, recall tracking  
✅ Visualizations of bounding boxes on tumor regions  
✅ Inference on new images with auto-saving detections  
✅ (Optional) Streamlit or FastAPI deployment for real-time detection

---

<h2 align="center">🗂️ Dataset</h2>

We use publicly available **MRI/CT Brain Tumor datasets** (e.g., Kaggle, Brats dataset):

- Images annotated with tumor bounding boxes.
- Data requires resizing and augmentation during preprocessing.
- Annotation file: `datasets/data.yml`.

<h2 align="center">🛠️ Installation</h2>

1️⃣ Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Brain-Tumor-Detection.git
cd Brain-Tumor-Detection

2️⃣ Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

python -m venv venv

# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

3️⃣ Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

<h2 align="center">🧠 Future Improvements</h2>
✅ Integrate Grad-CAM for explainability.
✅ Hyperparameter tuning using Optuna.
✅ Deploy on Streamlit for demo-ready inference UI.
✅ Extend detection to tumor type classification (e.g., glioma, meningioma).
✅ Export YOLO model to ONNX/TFLite for edge device inference.
